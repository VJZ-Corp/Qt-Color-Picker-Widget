# Qt-Color-Palette-Widget
This is the source code repository of the color picker GUI. The actual widget is designed in C++ and many underlying libraries are implemented by Qt. All rights reserved to Vincent Zhang.

<h1>About</h1>

This project was created with C++ and the Qt Framework. It features a simple Color Palette Dialog, in which users can adjust the RGB values and produce the equivalent color. Users can also use spin boxes to enter precise numbers. This repository is meant to display the source code only and will not serve any functionality if cloned. (see below)
